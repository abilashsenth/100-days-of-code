# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 10, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Built a tiny weather webapp in Express.js, worked with OpenWeatherAPI.

**Thoughts:** ExpressJs combined with Node is really awesome, and GET POST requests are cool too... parsing JSON was easy since I was aquainted already with OpenWeatherAPI
