# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 10, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Built a tiny weather webapp in Express.js, worked with OpenWeatherAPI.

**Thoughts:** ExpressJs combined with Node is really awesome, and GET POST requests are cool too... parsing JSON was easy since I was aquainted already with OpenWeatherAPI

### Day 2: January 14, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Learnt to host my day 1 MailChimp newsletter project in a heroku server today! And I kinda love it

**Thoughts:** Oh and I also learnt to edit a text file using VIM, and I feel like a 90s hacking god. The more you learn ðŸ‘€


### Day 3: January 18, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Learnt some primer EJS to perform templating, and populating content dynamically from server to the html page 

**Thoughts:** EJS is pretty fun, i guess ðŸ˜… But the way to dynamically populate content is something that I'll have to practice to perfect

### Day 4: January 20, 2022
